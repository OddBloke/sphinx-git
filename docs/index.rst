Welcome to sphinx-git's documentation!
======================================

sphinx-git is an extension to the `Sphinx documentation tool`_ that allows you
to include excerpts from your git history within your documentation.  This
could be used for release changelogs, to pick out specific examples of history
in documentation, or just to surface what is happening in the project.

See :ref:`recent_changes` below for an example of what can be done with it.
